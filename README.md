# numerai
My original submissions for the numer.ai data science competition

This notebook is depreciated and no longer works, but before, it worked by backtesting models that used random combinations of each feature set until one produced statistically viable returns. Then, the submission would be made.

## Benefits of adding randomness:
Higher meta model contribution than other people's submissions
Less correlation to the meta model as a whole, improving uniqueness
